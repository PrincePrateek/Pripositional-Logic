# Pripositional-Logic
Given a formula in propositional logic, Code to put appropriate and necessary brackets in the formula following the precedence order of operators. If not possible, output “Not well formed formula”. 


I have written Python Code to put appropriate and necessary brackets in the propositional logic formula following the precedence order of operators. If not possible output “Not well formed formula”.

I have used Python 3.9.10 while coding and testing my code.

This code can take propositional logic expressions as an input and put appropriate and necessary brackets in the propositional logic formula following the precedence order of operators.


I have implemented the stack as a list concept in python data structure to create this propositional logic formula bracket generator.

Before putting brackets, I have checked if the formula is well formed or not. For this I have created a function and inside that I have checked the conditions which shows that the propositional logic formula is well formed.

Once I have checked that the formula is well formed then I have converted the code to postfix expression. After that I have evaluated the postfix expression to put required brackets according to the precedence order.
